# This file contains an example Turing machine program in text format for testing purposes.
# The format includes the initial tape content, head position, and transition rules.

# Example Turing Machine Program
# Initial Tape: 1, 0, 1, 1, 0
# Head Position: 0
# Transitions:
# State 0, Read 1 -> Write 1, Move Right, Go to State 1
# State 1, Read 0 -> Write 1, Move Left, Go to State 0
# State 0, Read Blank -> Write Blank, Move Right, Go to Halt
